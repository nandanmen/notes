Collective Bargaining and Labour Relations</h1> <h2 id="role-of-unions-and-labour-relations"><a href="#role-of-unions-and-labour-relations" class="header-anchor">#</a> Role of Unions and Labour Relations</h2> <p>Labour unions represent workers' interests and participates in bargaining processes with employers.</p> <p><strong>Labour relations</strong> refers to a set of skills managers and union leaders can use to minimize cost of conflict and seek win-win solutions in disagreements.</p> <p>Labour relations involve three levels of decisions:</p> <ul><li><em>Labour relations strategy</em> <ul><li>For <strong>management</strong>, this decision involves how the organization will work with unions or develop nonunion operations.</li> <li>For <strong>unions</strong>, this decision involves whether to resist management changes or accept new kinds of labour-management relationships.</li> <li>This decision is influenced by outside factors such as public opinion and competition.</li></ul></li> <li><em>Negotiating contracts</em> <ul><li>Contract negotiations involve decisions on pay structure, job security, work rules, workplace safety, etc.</li></ul></li> <li><em>Administering collective agreements</em> <ul><li>These decisions involve day-to-day activities in which union members and the organization may have disagreements.</li> <li>e.g. work rules being violated or workers being treated unfairly.</li> <li>A formal grievance procedure is usually used to resolve these issues.</li></ul></li></ul> <h3 id="types-of-unions"><a href="#types-of-unions" class="header-anchor">#</a> Types of Unions</h3> <ul><li>Union members generally belong to either national or international unions.</li> <li>Unions are traditionally characterized as either <em>craft</em> or <em>industrial</em> unions.</li> <li>Unions affiliate with labour congresses for assistance at the national or international level. The <strong>Canadian Labour Congress</strong> has the most affiliation coverage compared to other labour congresses in Canada.</li></ul> <h4 id="local-unions"><a href="#local-unions" class="header-anchor">#</a> Local Unions</h4> <p>Most national unions consist of several <strong>local</strong> units. Negotiation often occurs at the local level for things such as work rules and other issues that are locally determined.</p> <h3 id="trends-in-union-membership"><a href="#trends-in-union-membership" class="header-anchor">#</a> Trends in Union Membership</h3> <p>In Canada there is a decline in union membership. There are several factors that seem to contribute to this:</p> <ul><li><em>Change in economic structure</em> <ul><li>Job growth among women and youth in service sector</li> <li>Most union members are urban blue-collar middle-aged workers</li></ul></li> <li><em>Management efforts against unionization</em> <ul><li>Almost half of large employers said their most important labour goal is to be union free</li></ul></li></ul> <h3 id="impact-of-unions-on-company-performance"><a href="#impact-of-unions-on-company-performance" class="header-anchor">#</a> Impact of Unions on Company Performance</h3> <p>With regards to <mark>productivity</mark>:</p> <ul><li>Unions may decrease productivity if:
<ul><li>Limits are set on workloads</li> <li>Production lost to union action e.g. strikes/work slowdowns</li></ul></li> <li>Unions may increase productivity if:
<ul><li>Reduce turnover by giving employees a way to solve problems</li> <li>Emphasize pay systems based on seniority which removes incentives to compete vs to cooperate</li></ul></li></ul> <p>Unions have other effects on company performance as well:</p> <ul><li>Management may be forced to pay greater than attention to employee needs and improve management practices</li> <li>Unions generally have a <mark>negative</mark> effect on profits
<ul><li>Union members are paid higher than nonunion members</li> <li>Higher union productivity does not counteract pay increases</li></ul></li></ul> <h2 id="goals-of-unions-and-management"><a href="#goals-of-unions-and-management" class="header-anchor">#</a> Goals of Unions and Management</h2> <h3 id="management"><a href="#management" class="header-anchor">#</a> Management</h3> <h4 id="primary-goals"><a href="#primary-goals" class="header-anchor">#</a> Primary goals</h4> <ul><li>Increase organization profits and/or increase productivity</li> <li>Prefer options that lower cost and raise output</li></ul> <h4 id="concerns"><a href="#concerns" class="header-anchor">#</a> Concerns</h4> <ul><li>Unions incur higher wages and benefits</li> <li>Raise risk of work stoppages</li> <li>Make managers and workers into opponents</li> <li>Limit management power over making business decisions</li></ul> <h4 id="in-labour-relations"><a href="#in-labour-relations" class="header-anchor">#</a> In labour relations</h4> <ul><li>Limit increases in wages and benefits</li> <li>Retain control over work rules and schedules</li></ul> <h3 id="unions"><a href="#unions" class="header-anchor">#</a> Unions</h3> <h4 id="primary-goals-2"><a href="#primary-goals-2" class="header-anchor">#</a> Primary goals</h4> <ul><li>Obtain pay, job security, and working conditions that satisfy their members</li> <li>Provide members with a voice in decisions that affects them</li></ul> <h4 id="methods"><a href="#methods" class="header-anchor">#</a> Methods</h4> <ul><li>Unions gather their strength through numbers. More union members means more power to the union.</li> <li>Large unions also have the financial means to hold longer strikes.</li> <li>Unions want to influence the <em>way</em> pay and promotions are determined.
<ul><li>Have pay be determined on seniority alone
<ul><li>The assumption is this pay is more objective than performance evaluations</li></ul></li> <li>Unionized workers under a particular job classification are generally paid the same rate</li></ul></li></ul> <h4 id="rand-formula"><a href="#rand-formula" class="header-anchor">#</a> Rand Formula</h4> <p>To survive, unions must ensure a regular flow of new members and member dues. The <em>Rand Formula</em> is a union security measure that enforces payment of labour union dues even if the worker is not part of the union.</p> <ul><li>The rationale is that all employees benefit from unionization.</li></ul> <p>The Rand formula is implemented in several ways:</p> <ol><li><strong>Checkoff provision</strong>: Employees automatically deduct union dues from employee paycheques.</li> <li><strong>Closed shop</strong>: A new employee must be a union member prior to being hired.</li> <li><strong>Union shop</strong>: Employees must join the union within a certain period of time after beginning employment.</li></ol> <h2 id="laws-and-regulations-affecting-labour-relations"><a href="#laws-and-regulations-affecting-labour-relations" class="header-anchor">#</a> Laws and Regulations Affecting Labour Relations</h2> <p>The <strong>Labour Relations Code</strong> (LRC) is a set of laws that regulates the union's size and bargaining power.</p> <p>Differs by province, but in BC its primary goals are:</p> <ul><li>Protect rights of employees to union representation</li> <li>Guards against &quot;unfair labour practices&quot; e.g. retaliation, discipline, threats against employees</li> <li>Sets rules for collective bargaining, strikes, and resolution of disputes (grievances)</li></ul> <p>The labour relations legislation has several overriding principles:</p> <ul><li>Maintenance of harmonious labour relations and industrial peace
<ul><li>Key rule is <strong>no strikes</strong> can occur during term of collective agreement</li></ul></li> <li>Protect employee freedom of choice</li> <li>Maintain employer right to run business as long as no interference with above</li></ul> <h2 id="union-organizing-process"><a href="#union-organizing-process" class="header-anchor">#</a> Union Organizing Process</h2> <ol><li><em>Membership application</em> <ul><li>Union representatives contact employees and invite them to sign an application for membership</li> <li>By signing the application, the employee indicates they want the union to represent them</li></ul></li> <li><em>Certification</em> <ul><li>When the union collects enough members, the union will apply to the appropriate LRB for certification.</li> <li>In BC, 45% of employees in Bargaining Unit must be members.</li> <li>&quot;Representation Vote&quot; is held; in BC, 55% of employees must show support for union.</li></ul></li></ol> <h3 id="bargaining-unit"><a href="#bargaining-unit" class="header-anchor">#</a> Bargaining Unit</h3> <p>Refers to the group of individuals that is represented by a union in collective bargaining.</p> <ul><li>The LRB has the <em>exclusive jurisdiction</em> to determine appropriate bargaining unit.</li> <li>Requires <strong>balance</strong> to maintain bargaining rights of employees and managers.</li></ul> <p>Some positions are excluded from the bargaining unit and as such will not be covered by the collective agreement:</p> <ul><li>Independent contractors</li> <li>Positions exercising managerial capacity
<ul><li>Specifically those positions with power over employment (hiring, firing, wages, etc.)</li></ul></li> <li>Positions acting in <em>confidential</em> capacity over labour relations</li></ul> <h3 id="management-strategies"><a href="#management-strategies" class="header-anchor">#</a> Management Strategies</h3> <p>Employers may retaliate when they learn that a large majority of employees have signed membership applications.</p> <p>Supervisors have the most direct impact on whether unionizations will go through because they have the most direct contact with employees.</p> <hr> <p><strong>What to do</strong></p> <ul><li>Report any direct or indirect signs of union activity to core management</li> <li>State company response to employees (should be coordinated with rest of company)</li> <li>Follow effective management practices to avoid union issues altogether:
<ul><li>Deliver recognition and appreciation</li> <li>Solve employee problems</li> <li>Protect employees from harassment or humiliation</li> <li>Provide business-related information</li> <li>Be consistent when treating employees</li> <li>Accommodate special circumstances when appropriate</li> <li>Ensure due process in performance management</li> <li>Treat all employees with dignity and respect</li></ul></li></ul> <p><strong>What to avoid</strong></p> <ul><li>Threat employees with harsher terms</li> <li>Interrogate employees about pro-union or anti-union sentiments</li> <li>Promising employees with favourable terms if they forego union activity</li></ul> <hr> <p>Generally, management have four options:</p> <ol><li><em>Union Acceptance</em> <ul><li>Accept inevitability of union involvement</li> <li><mark>Objective</mark>: negotiate best possible collective agreement</li></ul></li> <li><em>Union Resistance</em> <ul><li>Create opposition in organizing drives of sectors of company without union operations</li></ul></li> <li><em>Union Removal</em> <ul><li>Remove union that is already in place</li> <li>Drag out bargaining while simultaneously increase wages and benefits for non-union workers</li> <li>Brings high risk of strike activity</li></ul></li> <li><em>Union Avoidance/Substitution</em> <ul><li>Mimic union benefits</li> <li>Provide greater participation in management through joint employee-management councils</li> <li>Alternatively match wages with unionized employees in same industry</li></ul></li></ol> <h2 id="collective-bargaining"><a href="#collective-bargaining" class="header-anchor">#</a> Collective Bargaining</h2> <p>Determination of terms and conditions of employment through negotiations which results in a <strong>Collective Agreement</strong>.</p> <h3 id="collective-agreement"><a href="#collective-agreement" class="header-anchor">#</a> Collective Agreement</h3> <ul><li>Terms and conditions of employment that applies equally to <em>all</em> employees</li> <li>Regulate aspects of day-to-day relationships between workers, unions, and employers</li></ul> <h4 id="what-is-management-looking-for"><a href="#what-is-management-looking-for" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is management looking for?</h4> <ul><li>Leave as many management rights as possible</li> <li><strong>Factors affecting their decision</strong>:
