# Lecture 3 - Image Filtering

When a photon hits a surface, it bounces off with equal probability in all directions.

* This contributes to noise in low-light environments.

## Image as Functions

* A grayscale image is a 2D function `I(x, y)`, where `x` and `y` are the dimensions of the image
  * Its output is in the range `[0, 255]`
* **Filtering** an image changes the range of the image
* **Warping** an image changes the domain of the image
