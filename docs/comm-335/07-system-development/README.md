# Information Systems Development and Management

## System Development Life Cycle

The SDLC defines a series of phases in creating a system.

1. Plan -> Identify problem, need, or opportunity that the new system will address
2. Analyze -> Clearly define user requirements, current models (e.g. database) are analyzed to determine ==new system== requirements
3. Design -> Design new models given system requirements, determine optimal system architecture
4. Build/buy -> Build/buy and test new system
5. Install -> Integrate system (hardware and software) and train users to use new software. Migrate data from old system to new system
6. Deploy -> Deploy, maintain, and support new system

### Types of System Maintenance

* **Corrective** -> Detecting and correcting errors to make the system more efficient
* **Preventive** -> Help prevent system from future vulnerabilities
* **Adaptive** -> Modify system to keep it compatible with changing business requirements
* **Perfective** -> Fine tuning system to improve overall system quality

### Reasons for Change

* Changes in user or business needs
* Improved business processes
* Productivity gains
* Competitive advantage
* Technology changes
* System age

## System Development Methodologies

### Types of Methodologies

* Purchasing software
  * Method
    * Identify vendors
    * Send vendors a Request For Proposal (RFP)
    * Vendors reply with software proposal
    * Select from available proposals
  * Advantages
    * Fast
    * Simplifies decision making process
  * Drawbacks
    * Expensive
    * Vendor response rate?
* Developing software in-house
  * Significant competitive advantage -> software can be fine tuned to exactly what the business needs
  * Drawbacks
    * Costly
    * Time constraints
    * Poorly defined requirements -> poor system
    * Lack of qualified staff
* End-user computing -> allow user to create and implement simple systems
  * Advantages
    * Fine-tuned to user needs
    * Free up IT resources
    * Easy to use and understand
  * Drawbacks
    * Inadequately tested applications
    * High chance of duplication between users
    * Inefficient systems, poorly maintained
    * Too time consuming for users?
* Outsourcing -> contract foreign workers to develop software
  * Advantages
    * Free up company resources
    * Less time consuming
    * Access to greater expertise
    * Lower costs
  * Drawbacks
    * Loss of control
    * Inflexibility
    * Poor service?
* Prototyping -> Iterative process in designing prototypes and gathering user feedback to finetune prototypes
  * Advantages
    * Well-defined user needs
    * Higher user satisfaction and involvement
  * Drawbacks
    * Require significant user time
    * May not be resource efficient
    * Inadequate testing process
    * "Never-ending" development
* Agile development

## System Development Planning

### Teams

* Information Systems Steering Committee -> plans and oversees overall IS function
  * Develop objectives and system constraints
  * Develop strategic systems plan
  * Prioritize individual projects
* Management -> get users involved in process, align project to fit with organization goals
* Project Development Team -> plan and monitor project progress
* System Analysts -> determine information needs and plan specifications
* Programmers -> write and test programs according to specifications
* Users -> communicate needs to system developers, help design and test

### Feasibility Analysis

* Economic -> Do benefits of system justify the costs?
* Technical -> Is the technology needed to implement the system available?
* Legal -> Will the system comply with laws and regulations?
* Scheduling -> Can we develop the system in the time provided?
* Operational -> Do we have the workforce to implement the system? Will people use the system?
