# Information Systems Audit and Internal Controls

## Managing Fraud

Fraud -> intentional deception to secure unfair or unlawful gain, or to deprive someone of a legal right.

**Accounting fraud** -> intentional manipulation of financial statements to create facade of company health.

### Types of Fraud

* Corruption -> dishonest conduct typically involving bribery
* Misappropriation of assets -> theft of assets for personal gain
* Fraudulent financial reporting -> misstating financial statements to meet earnings targets

### Fraud Triangle

* **Perceived pressure** -> an employee feels a need to obtain cash or other assets
* **Rationalization** -> employee justifies their actions and convinces themselves that fraud is ok
* **Perceived opportunity** -> employee believes a chance exists to commit fraud, conceal it, and avoid punishment

### Preventing and Detecting Fraud

1. **Make fraud less likely to occur**

* Organizational
  * Create culture of integrity
  * Hold authority accountable for achieving business objectives
* Systems
  * Develop security policies

2. **Make it difficult to commit**

* Organizational
  * Segregate accounting functions
  * Require independent checks and reconciliation of data
* Systems
  * Restrict access; implement authentication system

3. **Improve detection**

* Organizational
  * Assess fraud risk
  * External and internal audits
* Systems
  * *Audit trail* of transactions through system

4. **Reduce fraud losses**

* Organizational
  * Insurance
  * Business continuity and disaster recovery plan
* Systems
  * Store backup copies of program and data files
  * Monitor system activity

## Internal Controls

Internal controls refer to processes that are implemented to improve security and system validity.

Specifically, internal controls aim to fulfill the following objectives:

* Safeguard assets
* Maintain sufficient records
* Provide accurate and reliable information
* Prepare financial reports according to established criteria
* Promote and improve operational efficiency
* Encourage adherence to management policies
* Comply with laws and regulations

### Functions of Internal Controls

* Preventive Controls -> **prevent or reduce** likelihood of fraud
* Detective Controls -> **discover** fraud when it occurs and alert management
* Corrective Controls -> **investigate** and take corrective action to remedy harm caused

### Risk Assessment

Risk -> probability an event that would negatively impact organization's ability to achieve goals occurs.

**Risk assessment** -> analysis the *extent* to which such an event would impact the organization's ability to achieve goals.

* **Risk impact** -> the effect that such an event would have on the organization's ability to achieve goals.
* **Risk likelihood** -> the probability such an event would occur.

**Responses to Risk**

* Avoidance -> avoid or exit the activities that give rise to risk
* Reduction -> take action to reduce risk likelihood and/or risk impact
* Sharing -> reduce risk likelihood and/or risk impact by *sharing* risk e.g. insurance
* Acceptance -> no action taken to reduce risk

## COBIT Framework

COBIT -> Control Objectives for Information and related Technology

* Framework defines _goals and objectives_ for the controls that should be in place for management of information technology.

**COBIT Cube** -> IT ==processes== use IT ==resources== to achieve IT ==goals== that are *related* to business requirements.

### IT Resources

* **Applications** -> Manual and automated processes used for information processing
* **Information** -> Any structured and unstructured data
* **Infrastructure** -> Hardware, software, data centre facility, other technology
* **People**

### Information Criteria

* Confidentiality -> protect confidential data from unauthorized use
* Integrity -> ensure data accuracy, completeness, and validity
* Availability -> ensure data is available when needed
* Effectiveness -> information is relevant, accurate, and usable
* Efficiency -> information is provided in most economic and productive way
* Compliance -> information conforms with laws and regulations
* Reliability -> information can be relied upon

## Auditing Information Systems

Auditing -> Systematic process of obtaining and evaluating **evidence** regarding **assertions** to determine how well they correspond with established criteria.

* Lack of physical procedures makes auditing ISes complex.

**IS Audit** -> Assess proper implementation, operation, and control of computer resources.

* **Purpose** of audit is to review and evaluate the system's availability, confidentiality, and integrity.

## IT Controls

Three levels of IT controls:

* Entity-level controls -> **Organization** level IT controls such as strategic plans, policies and procedures, risk management activities, QA, IT training, etc.
* Application controls -> Controls embedded within business applications
  * **Input** controls -> Ensure valid, accurate, and complete input data
  * **Processing** controls -> Ensure each transaction is:
    * Processed
    * Not processed more than once
    * Traceable
  * **Output** controls -> System output is not lost, corrupted, or misdirected
* General controls
  * Ensure continued IT operation and availability
