# Product Strategy

## Products and Product Types

### Product Components

A **product** is anything that might satisfy a *want* or *need*. A product has three major components:

1. *Core customer value*: The basic problem-solving benefits that customers are seeking.
2. *Actual product*: The core customer value gets turned into an actual product, which involve the physical attributes such as branding, packaging, features, etc.
3. *Associated services*: Any **non-physical** additions to the product, such as warranties, financing, product support, etc.

### Product Types

There are four main types of *consumer* products:

1. *Specialty*: All products for which customers will expend considerable effort to get.
     * For mountain bike enthusiasts, specialty products would be mountain bikes.
     * Luxury goods such as high-end cars or apparel also fit here.
2. *Shopping*: All products for which customers will spend considerable effort *comparing alternatives*; they will go "from shop to shop" to find the best possible product.
     * Things like furniture, apparel, etc.
3. *Convenience*: Products that customers spend little time thinking about.
     * Common household commodities like dish soap, tissues, etc.
4. *Unsought*: Products that customers do not know about.
     * Any "new-to-the-world" goods, such as new tech.

## Product Mix

A company's **product mix** is the complete set of all of their products and services.

A product mix typically consist of several **product lines**, which are groups of associated products that are typically used together or customers group together.

* The *breadth* of a product mix is the number of *product lines*.
* The *depth* of a product mix is the number of products *within* a product line.

### Product Mix Decisions

* **Increase depth**: Adding items to a product line
  * Address changing consumer preferences or preempt competitors
* **Decrease depth**: Removing items from a product line
  * Eliminate unprofitable and low margin products
  * Refocus marketing efforts to other higher priority products
* **Increase breadth**: Add new product lines
  * Capture new or evolving markets
* **Decrease breadth**: Remove product lines
  * Address changing market conditions or meet internal strategic goals

Increasing depth is also referred as *line extensions* while increasing breadth is also known as *brand extensions*.

**Line extensions**

* Pros
  * Finer segmentation can meet consumer needs better
  * Lower introduction costs
* Cons
  * *Cannibalization*: Reduction in sales of one product as a result of the introduction of a new product
  * Incresaed production cost and complexity

**Brand Extensions**

* Pros
  * Avoid cost of new brand development
  * More efficient promotion
* Cons
  * Credibility
  * Dilution of parent brand

## Services

The marketing of services differs from product marketing because of four fundamental differences in services.

### Intangible

Services are intangible. This intangibility provides some difficulty when it comes to marketing services:

* Difficult to convey the benefits
  * Offer "cues" to help customers perceive and experience their services in a more positive manner
* Difficult to promote
  * Marketers must creatively employ symbols or pictures to make their service seem more tangible

### Inseparable

Services are produced and consumed *at the same time*. This means that service consumption and production are inseparable.

* Customers are not able to "try" the service before they purchase it
  * When having a haircut, it's not possible to test whether the haircut will work out without actually doing it
  * Service firms sometimes provide extended warranties and 100% satisfaction guarantees to counteract this inseparability

### Heterogenous

Services are more likely to have variability or *heterogeneity* when it comes to the service's quality.

* Inferior products can be recalled and replaced; the same cannot be done for inferior services
  * Marketers can use the variable nature of a service to their advantage by customising the service to the customers' needs *exactly*
  * Alternatively humans are replaced with machines to counteract the variability
    * Using an ATM machine is more convenient and less variable than going to a bank teller

### Perishable

Services are *perishable* because they cannot be stored for later consumption.

* Perishability makes it difficult for marketers to match the demand and supply of the service
  * Marketers can use this opportunity by e.g. lowering prices during lower-demand intervals

## Growth Strategies

![Growth strategies matrix](./growth-strategies.png)

### Market Penetration

Employs the existing marketing mix and focuses the firm's efforts on existing customers.

* Primary goals
  * *Steal market share*: Attract new customers from currently targeted segment
  * *Intensify consumption*: Encourage existing customers to buy more or more frequently
* Requires greater marketing efforts
  * Increased advertising
  * Additional sales and promotions
* Intensified distribution efforts

### Market Development

Employs the existing market offering to *new* markets.

* International expansion is risky because firms must deal with differences in government regulations, cultural traditions, supply chains, and language.
* US firms may see a competitive advantage because US culture is widely emulated for consumer products.

### Diversification

Offer a *new* product to a *new* target segment. Diversification can either be *related* or *unrelated*.

* Related diversification
  * The new market shares something in common with the current market
    * Firms can reuse distribution channels/information systems
    * Can purchase from same vendors
* Unrelated diversification
  * New market has no relation to current market
  * **Highest risk** because of difference from core business

## New Product Development

A growth strategy whereby firms introduce a *new* product to the *current* target segment.

* *Innovation*: Process of transforming ideas into new products
* *Diffusion* of innovation: Process by which new products *spread* throughout a market group

### Why do Firms Innovate?

1. *Changing customer needs*
   * Firms can better create and deliver value by keeping up with changing consumer needs
   * New products can also reduce the possibility of consumers being "bored" of the current product
2. *Market saturation*
   * The longer a product is in the market, the more likely that market is going to be saturated
3. *Risk management*
   * Innovation allows firms to expand their product portfolio
   * Having a diverse portfolio reduces risk as some products may do well when others are doing poorly
4. *Fashion cycles*
   * In industries that face short product lifecycles, firms must repeatedly release new "versions" so consumers are satisfied
5. *Improving business relationships*

### Diffusion of Innovation

**Pioneers** are new-to-the-world products that either establishes new markets or drastically changes the "rules" of current markets.

:::tip Market rules
"Rules" refer to rules of competition and consumer preferences.
:::

* Pioneers are *first movers*
  * As the first to create a market, they are easily recognizable by consumers and establish an early market share lead

Pioneers often fail because:

* Competitors capitalize on their faults
* May have relatively high price points
* May have poor or unoptimal design

### Types of Users

![Diffusion of innovation curve](./innovation-curve.png)

The diffusion of innovation curve (above) shows that the spread of a new product generally follows a bell-shaped curve.

* *Innovators*: Buyers who want to be the first to have the new product or service.
* *Early adopters*: Buyers who are interested in new products but don't wish to take as mush risk as innovators. Usually wait to purchase the product after *careful review*.
* *Early majority*: New products are generally not profitable until this group starts purchasing them. Number of competitors also reached its peak.
* *Late majority*: The product has reached peak market potential. Sales usually level off or start to decline.
* *Laggards*: This group likes to avoid change and tend to rely on traditional products until they are no longer available.
