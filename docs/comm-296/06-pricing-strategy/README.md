# Pricing Strategy

**Price** can be defined as the overall *sacrifice* a customer is willing to make to acquire a product.

## Five Cs of Pricing

### Company Objectives

A firm's pricing strategy should align with their overall objectives. A firm can be characterized as one of four types based on their strategic goal.

* *Profit orientated*: Implement three pricing strategies revolving around profits
  * **Target profit pricing** -> Set price to reach a specific profit goal
  * **Maximize profit** -> Use economic theory to find price that maximizes profits
  * **Target return pricing** -> Set price that maximizes return on investment
* *Sales oriented*: Sets prices to maximize sales (unit sales/dollar sales, etc)
  * Sometimes as part of an overall goal to gain market share
  * Lowest priced product not always most dominant
  * Some firms utilize **premium pricing** -> attract customers who care most about quality and/or money is not a problem
* *Competitor oriented*: Sets prices relative to competition only
  * **Competitive parity** -> Set price similar to competition
  * **Status quo pricing** -> Change price in response to competitor price changes
* *Customer oriented*: Sets prices to maximize customer *value*

### Customers

Price directly affects customers' perecption of value.

* For ==regular products==, increase in price -> decrease in demand
* For **prestige products**, increase in price -> increase in demand (up to a certain point)
  * Customers value the increase in prestige > increase in price

**Price Elasticity**

* Measures how *much* demand changes as prices change
  * Market is said to be elastic if its PED is < -1; relatively small changes in price will lead to large increases in demand
  * Inelastic if PED is > -1 -> firms can freely increase price without much changes in demand

Some customers are more sensitive to price than others.

* Firms respond to this through **dynamic pricing** -> a strategy to charge different customers different prices.

**Factors Affecting Price Elasticity**

* *Income effect*: Change in demand of a product as consumer incomes change.
  * Generally higher incomes -> trend towards more expensive products.
* *Substitution effect*: Availability of substitute products.
  * More substitute products -> higher elasticity of the product demand
* *Cross-price elasticity*: Change in demand of a product in response to a change in price of another product
  * If an increase in price of one product -> increase in demand of another, then the two products are **substitutes**.
  * If an increase in price of one product -> ==decrease== in demand of another, then the two products are **complementary**.

### Costs

* Variable costs -> costs that vary with production volume
* Fixed costs -> costs that don't vary with production volume
* Total cost -> variable + fixed costs

**Break-Even Analysis**

Find *break-even point* -> point where total revenue = total costs.

* Break-even point defined as ==fixed cost / contribution per unit==
  * Contribution per unit is unit price - variable costs

### Competition

There are four levels of competition: monopoly, oligopolistic competition, monopolistic competition, and pure competition.

* *Monopoly*
  * Market dominated by one firm
  * No price competition; price usually regulated by government or government breaks down monopoly to allow competition
* *Oligopolistic competition*
  * Market dominated by few firms
  * Firms usually change prices in response to price changes of competitors -> may lead to **price wars**
  * May introduce **predatory pricing** -> deliberately set low prices to drive competition out of business
* *Monopolistic competition*
  * Many competing firms with differentiated products
  * Customers perceive value not only on price but also product differences
  * Allows creation of unique value propositions
* *Pure competition*
  * Many competing firms with ==substitutable== products
  * Price set based on market forces (supply and demand)
  * Firms may move out of pure competition by providing a point of difference in their products

### Channel Members

Channel members refer to parties involved in distribution: manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers.

* If members have different price orientations, conflicts may occur
* Rise of *gray markets*: Legal but irregular channels of distribution to sell goods at lower prices than market
* Manufacturers require signed agreements before retailers are allowed to be authorized

## Pricing Terms

* Retail selling price (RSP)
* Manufacturer selling price (MSP)
* Gross margin = manufacture price - variable costs
* Contribution margin = sales revenue - variable costs
* Markup = RSP - MSP / MSP
* Margin = RSP - MSP / RSP
* Profit = gross margin - unit fixed cost

### Example

Feathers and Foam Ltd sells its duvet covers for $100 to Ed's Linens. The variable cost per duvet cover is $40. Ed's Linens prices it at $120 in its retail stores.

* What is F&F's gross margin %? `(100-40)/100 = 60%`
* What is Ed's markup? `120-100 = 20 / 100 = 20%`
* With a markup of 30%, what margin would Ed generate?
  * RSP = 1.3 * 100 = 130
  * Margin = 130 - 100 / 130 = 23%
* If F&F sells 500 covers to Ed's, what is the total dollar contribution?
  * Total revenue = 500 * 100 = $50000
  * Total variable cost = 500 * 40 = $20000
  * Total dollar contribution = 50,000 - 20,000 = $30,000
* If F&F were considering a price decrease of 5%, what number of units would they need to sell in order to generate the same dollar contribution?
  * New price = $95
  * Required revenue = $50,000
  * Quantity = 50,000/95 = 527 units

## Pricing Strategies

### Everyday Low Pricing (EDLP)

* Set prices somewhere between market price and sale prices
* On *average* prices will be lower than competitors

### High/Low Pricing

* Provide sales where prices are temporarily lower
* Attracts two segments: price insensitive individuals who are willing to pay the "high" price and price sensitive individuals looking to pay the "low" price
* Uses *reference price* to compare sale prices
  * Increases perceived value as consumers see how much they are saving

### New Product Strategies

New products have their own pricing strategies because it is more difficult to determine the customer's perception of their value.

* *Market penetration pricing* -> Set initially low prices to gain market share and build sales.
  * *Experience curve effect* -> Drop in unit costs as sales volume increases
  * Discourages competitors from entering market because of low margins
  * Late entrants would see higher unit costs unless they can quickly build volume
  * Drawbacks:
    * Firm must have capacity to keep up with rapid sales
    * Low prices may signal low quality
    * Not suitable for markets where individuals are willing to pay higher prices
* *Price skimming* -> Set high initial price to attract innovators and early adopters, then slowly reduce prices
  * Product has to be innovative in some way
  * Reasons firms use price skimming:
    * Signal high quality to market
    * Test demand elasticity for the product (easy to lower price, hard to raise price)
    * Quickly earn back high R&D costs
  * Drawbacks:
    * Does not work if low barriers of entry -> competitors can simply charge lower prices
    * High unit costs associated with low sales volume -> tradeoff between high price and high production costs
    * Must eventually lower prices -> margins go down and initial buyers may be irritated at price drops

## Pricing Tactics

* Promotional pricing -> markdowns/discounts/coupons/rebates
* Bundling -> Packaging basket of products together at one price
* Addons -> Base price for main product + any extras for complementary goods

## Legal and Ethical Aspects of Pricing

### Deceptive or Illegal Price Advertising

* *Deceptive reference prices*
  * Reference prices must be "bona fide" and not fictious
  * Difficult to determine what makes a reference price "bona fide"
* *Loss leader pricing* -> pricing items at a loss to generate store traffic
  * Illegal in some states
* *Bait-and-switch* -> lure customers with very low prices with the intent of not selling the low price item
  * Hard to prove because sellers would want customers to buy a higher-priced item instead
* *Predatory pricing* -> set low prices with the intention of driving competitors out of business
* *Price discrimination* -> sell same product to different resellers at different prices.
  * Ok if targeted to end consumers (e.g. seniors and students often get discounts)
* *Price fixing* -> colluding with other firms to control prices
  * ==Horizontal== -> firms that produce *competing* goods collude to control prices
  * ==Vertical== -> parties at different levels of the same marketing channel (e.g. manufacturers, retailers) agree to fix price for end consumer
