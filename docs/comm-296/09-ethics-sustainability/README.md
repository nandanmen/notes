# Ethics and Sustainability

## Framework for Ethical Management

### Identify Clear Values

Organizational values should capture the purpose of the organization as well as the principles and standards used to guide decision making at all levels.

* Ensure organizational values are clear and regularly discussed
* Commit to *acting* on values by partnering with other organizations with similar values
* Add a **values check** as a key step in the decision making process

:::tip Example
**Bombas socks** donates a pair of socks for every sock that is purchased from them.
:::

### Understand Your Value Proposition to Society

Business provide value. When that business succeeds by becoming the market's product of choice, that value becomes the value to society.

When that happens, business decisions must always align with its value proposition to society. Unethical acts may occur when decisions are misaligned.

:::warning Example
A bad example of this is lean-washing, when a company displays a product as being more healthy than it actually is.
:::

**Greenwashing** is the practice of companies *saying* that they are doing environmental good but is not actually doing it.

* Regularly focus on defining and clarifying the value proposition 
* Add a **value check**-value as in the value _proposition_-in the decision making process

### Identify Vulnerable People and Protect Them

A vulnerable consumer is someone who lacks the power to properly stand up for themselves in a particular scenario e.g. children.

:::warning Example
Children are common targets of sugary foods advertisements.
:::

* Proactively seek if there are vulnerable groups who may be affected by a decision or action
* Seek industry standards and guidelines to protect vulnerable groups
* Obey all competition and consumer protection laws

### Respect Others' Interests

Competition is important but "winning" shouldn't come at the expense of other people's rights and interests.

* Seek industry standards
* Use information to *inform* rather than *mislead*

:::tip Example
Vape companies are advertising their products by claiming lifestyle benefits and kid-friendly flavours.  
:::

### Strive for Sustainability

Organizations should aim for positive impact and continuous improvement in not only economic performance but also social and environmental.
