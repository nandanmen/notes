# Normative Analysis of Government

## Philosophical Foundations of Government Policy

The basic element of government philosophy should be the primacy or sovereignty of the individual.

* **Economic freedom**
  * Individuals should be able to freely enter into voluntary agreements to exchange goods
  * Not an absolute law; governments often prevent the sale of some goods (e.g. drugs)
* **Consumer sovereignty**
  * Individuals have the right to their preferences
  * Governments should provide an environment that allows individuals to pursue these preferences

## Private Enterprise and Individualism

Market based economies generally perform better than socialist economies.

* Per-capita living standards fell in China when Mao suppressed the emergence of private markets

## Adam Smith and the Competitive Paradigm

Insights:

* Individuals acting in their own best interest may result in greater societal welfare
* Voluntary exchange between two parties won't happen unless they mutually benefit from it
* Little rational exists for government intervention, except:
  * Preventing concentrations of monopoly power
  * Providing public goods (which would be underprovided in private markets)
* Private enterprise can work well **only** if market is adequately competitive

## Meaning of Competition

Competition -> Rivarly among sellers in a market.

Characteristics of **perfect competition**:

* Numerous buyers and sellers such that neither buyer nor seller has control over price
* Homogenous products i.e. sellers sell same product
* Buyers and sellers have perfect competition
* No barriers of entry in long run

Analysis of perfect competition leads to two theorems:

1. Private markets under perfect competition achieve Pareto efficiency
2. Pareto efficiency can be maintained through income redistribution and allowing markets to operate freely

Political arguments to competition:

* Economic competition encourages democratic political institutions

## Normative Reasons for Government Intervention

One important reason for government policy -> **monopolies**.

Ways government can intervene:

1. Encourage or enhance competition
2. Regulate industry, imposing maximum pricing and other performance requirements
3. Direct government internship - public enterprise

## Efficiency and Market Failure

Private markets sometimes fail to achieve Pareto efficiency.

Major sources of market failure:

1. Imperfect competition
2. Asymmetric information
3. Incomplete property rights (externalities)
4. Poor government policies (sometimes referred as *government failure*)

### Imperfect Competition

* Individual firms may have considerable control over market price
* There are usually barriers to entry

### Asymmetric Information

* Consumers are often poorly informed
* Unaware of their true marginal benefit
* Government may provide regulations or invest in programs that convey appropriate information to consumers

### Public Goods

Public goods are:

* Nonrival in competition -> Multiple people may simultaneously consume the good
* Nonexclusive -> Impossible or very costly to exclude any particular individual from consuming the good

Private markets will not provide public goods.

* Nonexclusive means no consumer has an incentive to pay for the good

### Externalities

Externalities happen when a person or group is affected by the economic activity of others, without a market to put a price on the effect.

* May be negative -> pollution kills fish where fishing boats operate
* May be positive -> owning garden that others enjoy looking at

### Government Failure

Poorly designed policies often cause market failures.

* Rent controls
  * Place upper limit on how expensive rent can be to protect renters
  * Lead to suppliers supplying less housing
  * Lead to long waitlists and black market payments
