# Fairness, Ethics, and Public Policy

People should be treated *as they deserve*.

* Horizontal equity -> People who are alike in relevant factors should be treated equally
* Vertical equity -> People who differ in relevant factors should be treated differently

## Moral Relativism

Individuals and organizations should be evaluated based on the morals and values of the society in which they reside.

Problems:

* Prevent from criticizing obviously unacceptable practices
* Eliminates concept of moral progress
* Provides no basis for choosing between conflicting views

## Philosophical Approaches to Ethics and Fairness

Two systematic approaches to judge ethical behaviour:

* **Duty-based** -> Individual must fulfill various duties that are considered to be intrinsically ethical
* **Teleological** -> Ethical behaviour is one that produces good consequences

### Benefits Principle

Fair and ethical behaviour should be based on the benefits (and costs) experienced by those affected by the behaviour.

* Duty-based approaches do not conform to the benefits principle

### Strict Utilitarianism

Ethical and fair actions are those that maximize **total utility**.

Problems:

* Utility is often not comparable between individuals
* Unfairly favor those who is "easier" to make happy
* Offers weak individual protection
  * If an action sacrifices an individual for the benefits of everyone else, is it really moral?

### Rule Utilitarianism

Strict utilitarianism analyses on a case-by-case basis. Rule utilitarianism suggests to ask yourself how the action would affect total utility *if everyone acted this way*.

Problems:

* Should the rule be absolute? In what situations would it be ethical to break the rule?
* Might result in assessing case-by-case anyway

### Kant's Categorical Imperative

Ethical duties and rules are derived from a fundamental principle known as the **categorical imperative**.

Essentially an action is ethical when the answer to the following questions is ==yes==:

1. Is it logically *possible* for everyone to act this way?
2. Would I *want* everyone to act this way?

The main argument against the categorical imperative is the question of what to do if moral duties conflict.

### Social Covenants and Contracts

A fair or just system is one that everyone voluntarily agree to join.

* Rules are duties that people unanimously agreed upon
* "People" are assumed to be fundamentally rational

**Principles of justice**

1. *Equal liberty principle* -> Everyone is granted the same liberties, and those liberties are as broad as possible
2. Distribution of social and economic goods
   1. All offices and positions must be open to all under conditions of "equal opportunity"
   2. Society must aim to maximize the well-being of the worst-off person (*maxi-min principle*)

Main problem -> Maxi-min principle puts too great of an emphasis on the worst-off person.

* Who is the worst-off person? What about their situation makes them "worst-off"?

### Procedural Fairness

Adopting fair procedures means fairness is achieved, regardless of what the outcomes may be.

* Differs from *distributive* fairness, which considers the potential outcomes.

### Rights

Rights are requirements for procedural fairness.

* *Non-coercion* -> Individuals may not be forced into taking positive action that they themselves are not willing to take.
  * Is it okay for this right to be broken if it is for the greater benefit of society?

Most democratic constitutions implement a mixture of rights-based and benefits-based approaches.

## Trade-Offs Between Efficiency and Fairness

There exists a trade-off between efficiency and fairness with regards to public policies.

* Most principles of fairness conclude that income should be redistributed from the relatively well-off to the relatively worse-off
* Policies that encourage fairness often lead to low efficiency due to (a lack of) incentive effects
  * *Rent controls* -> Housing shortages, tenants screened based off personal preferences
  * *Unemployment insurance* -> Reduce incentive to work
