# Positive Theory of Government

Positive analysis -> Why do governments choose the policies that they do?

* Policy makers act on their self-interests
  * Wish to be re-elected -> influenced by voting patterns

## Voting

* *Direct democracy* -> Voters vote directly on policy issues.
* *Representative democracy* -> Voters vote to elect certain representatives, then those representatives decide on policies.

### Representative Voting

Many policies are in place despite being against the majority of the population.

* *Expert judgement* -> Representatives have the capacity to obtain expert information and may make more informed decisions.
* *Interest-group lobbying* -> Representatives are more subject to lobbying of specific interest groups compared to private individuals.
* *Background differences* -> Representatives are often not representative of their population.
  * Higher incomes, higher education, more advantageous backgrounds

### Hotelling's Theory of Political Parties

* In a system dominated by two parties, policy platforms will not differ much
* Policy platforms will match the preferences of the median voter

### Committee Voting

* Majority voting -> Commitee votes on options and option with most votes win
  * May often lead to ties
  * All vote for each individual project, agenda setter deals with ties based on their own preferences
