# Useful Economic Concepts

## Opportunity Cost

**Opportunity cost** -> Value of the best foregone alternative.

* A project should only be undertaken if its value exceeds its opportunity cost.
* Opportunity cost is seldom recognized.

## Marginalism

The marginal effect of any activity is the effect of doing that activity *a little bit* more.

* e.g. marginal revenue of selling a product is the revenue obtained from selling one more unit of that product.

Price reflects *marginal* value, not total value.

* Water is abundant and most people already have as much water as they would like
  * Consumers have less willingness to purchase a little more water
* Diamonds are scarce, so consumers are more willing to purchase one more diamond

**Marginalist principle** -> Any policy or activity should be carried out as long as its *marginal* benefit exceeds its *marginal* opportunity cost

* e.g. increasing education expenditures
  * Expenditure should keep increasing until marginal benefit = marginal cost
  * When MC > MB, increasing expenditure would only result in a net loss in value

Best way to allocate a scarce resource among two projects is to equalize marginal benefits:

Notes on the graph:

* X axis represents proportion of land use
* Y axis represents marginal value of land for that particular resource

This is the best allocation because:

* If $MV_H$ > $MV_P$, we would benefit by having more land for housing and less on parks
* If $MV_H$ < $MV_P$, we would benefit by having more land for parks and less on housing

Another way of looking at it is that the opportunity cost of housing is park land. Therefore $MV_P = MC_H$, and we should allocate more land to housing as long as marginal value exceeds marginal cost.

## Economic Incentives

==We expect people to follow economic incentives.==

* Policy changes that affect incentives typically have obvious outcomes
* Other times may induce unintended incentive effects
  * e.g. tax breaks for R&D programs led to companies rewriting regular expenses as R&D expenses
* Individuals and policy makers often fail to anticipate incentive effects

## Economic Efficiency

Different notions of efficiency:

* *Production* efficiency -> No inputs are wasted
* *Management* efficiency -> Cost is minimized (requires production efficiency)
* *Pareto* efficiency -> Resources are allocated in a way that it is impossible to make someone better off without making someone else worse off

Pareto is closely related to **deadweight loss**.

* Deadweight loss -> Net welfare gain that *could* be generated by reallocating resources to a more efficient allocation.

![Deadweight loss](./02-pareto.png)

* Demand curve represents marginal benefit gained from one extra unit of good
* Supply curve represents marginal cost from producing that extra unit
* At $Q_a$, people are willing to pay price $P_a$ for one extra unit of good
* At $Q_a$, suppliers are willing to accept $MC_a$ for producing one extra unit of good
* Since people only pay $MC_a$, there is an overall gain of welfare of $P_a-MC_a$ to society

This same logic continues until $Q^*$, where $MC=MB$ and no additional gain can be achieved by changing quantity.

* The area ABF is the *deadweight loss* from producing at $Q_a$.

### Implications

In the real world Pareto efficiency is never achieved.

* Pareto **improvement** -> Some people can be made better off without making someone else worse off.
	* Theoretically always possible if currently Pareto-inefficient.

A Pareto improvement can also be seen when the winners win *more* than the losers *lose*.

* Assumes that any form of redistribution of income is acceptable
