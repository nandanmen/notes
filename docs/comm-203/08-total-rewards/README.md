# Total Rewards

## Generational Emphasis

* *Boomers* — High-visibility projects, promotions, personal learning, industry recognition
* *Gen X* — Training, learning and development, challenging tasks, independent work environment, work/life balance, variable pay
* *Gen Y* — Meaningful work/projects, feedback, casual work environment, mentoring, social activities, flextime

## Incentive (Variable) Pay

**Incentive pay** refers to forms of pay linked to an employee's performance as an individual, group member, or organization member.

For incentive pay to be effective, the plan must meet the following requirements:

* Performance measures are linked to the organization's goals.
* Employees believe they can meet performance standards.
* The organization provides the resources necessary to meet the goals.
* Employees value the rewards given.
* Employees believe the reward system is fair.
* The plan takes into account that employees may ignore any goals that are not rewarded.

### Pay for Individual Performance

* *Standard hour plans* — An incentive plan that pays workers extra for work done in less than a preset "standard time".
* *Merit pay* — A system of linking pay increases to ratings on performance appraisals.

### Pay for Team Performance

* *Gainsharing* — Team incentive program that measures improvements in productivity and effectiveness and distributes a portion of each gain to employees.

For gainsharing to work correctly, the organization must provide the appropriate conditions. These conditions include:

* Management commitment
* Management acceptance and encouragement of employee input
* High levels of cooperation and interaction
* Employment security
* Information sharing on productivity and costs
* Goal setting
