# Training, Learning and Development

## Needs Assessment

Instructional design begins with **needs assessment**, the process of evaluating the organization and employees to determine what kinds of training, if any, is required.

Three types of analyses are involved in this proces:

* **Organizational analysis** — Assesses training needs by looking at organization characteristics such as strategy, resources, and management support.
* **Person analysis** — Assesses training needs by looking at individuals' needs and readiness for learning.

The appropriate response to a performance issue is not always training. Training can only solve a performance issue if it is inherently caused by a lack of knowledge or skill. Other factors such as motivation and performance feedback can contribute to a performance deficit.
	
* **Task analsyis** — Assesses training needs by looking at the tasks, skills, knowledge, and behaviours that training should emphasise.
