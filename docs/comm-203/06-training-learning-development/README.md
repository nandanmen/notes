# Training, Learning and Development

## Training and Organizational Strategy

Advancement and rapid changes in modern technology requires employees to be able to constantly **learn new skills**.

> Emphasizing career, training, and development can lead to gains in competitive advantage.

Instructional design is a five step process:

* Assess needs for training
* Ensure readiness for training
* Plan training program
* Implement training program
* Evaluate training program

## Needs Assessment

Instructional design begins with **needs assessment**, the process of evaluating the organization and employees to determine what kinds of training, if any, is required.

Three types of analyses are involved in this proces:

* **Organizational analysis** — Assesses training needs by looking at organization characteristics such as strategy, resources, and management support.
* **Person analysis** — Assesses training needs by looking at individuals' needs and readiness for learning.

  The appropriate response to a performance issue is not always training. Training can only solve a performance issue if it is inherently caused by a lack of knowledge or skill. Other factors such as motivation and performance feedback can contribute to a performance deficit.
	
* **Task analsyis** — Assesses training needs by looking at the tasks, skills, knowledge, and behaviours that training should emphasise.

## Readiness for Learning

*Readiness for learning* refers to a combination of employee characteristics and a positive work environment that encourages learning.

### Employee Readiness Characteristics

* Employees require basic learning skills, particularly ==cognitive ability==
  * Recent studies suggest companies may have to work with employees who *lack* basic skills
* Must be highly motivated
  * Willing to learn about the ==content== of the training program
  * Employees tend to feel motivated if:
    * They believe they can learn the subject
    * They feel they benefit from learning the subject
    * Are aware that it is a subject that they need to learn about
    * See connection between subject and career goals
  * Management can encourage this behaviour by providing appropriate *positive* feedback

### Work Environment

* *Situational constraints* -> Limits on effectiveness of training that exists in the work environment
  * e.g. lack of time and recourses or medium to apply training knowledge
* *Social support* -> Ways the organization's people encourage training
  * Establish **community of practice** -> group of employees who work together and learn from each other

## Plan Training Program

### Clarify Objectives

Effective training objectives have three components:

* Statement of employee expectations
* Measurable performance standards
* Identifies necessary resources

### In-House or Contracting Out?

Organizations can provide either in-house training or contract out training.

* Contracting out is a more viable option for organizations who lack necessary resources
  * More expensive

Organizations can contract out by sending a *Request for Proposal* (RFP). Vendors who believe they can fulfill the request send back proposals, and the organization selects from those proposals.

## Available Training Methods

### Individual Training

* *Classroom instruction*
  * Instructor leading a group
  * Good for presenting information on specific topic to *many* trainees
* *Audiovisual training*
  * Similar to classroom instruction but without an instructor
  * Trainees learn individually having access to course materials
* *On-the-job training*
  * Person with job experience and skills train trainees during work
  * ==Apprenticeship== -> combination of OTJ training and classroom training
  * ==Internship== -> OTJ training funded by an educational institution
  * ==Cooperative education== -> component of higher education that integrates paid internships as part of educational program
* *Simulations*
  * Represent real-life situations with trainees making decisions that lead to outcomes similar to what can happen on the job

### Building Interpersonal Skills

* *Behaviour modelling*
  * Participants observe individuals practicing the desired behaviour then they themselves practice the behaviour
* *Experiential programs*
  * Participants learn concepts then apply them by simulating real-life behaviours
  * ==Adventure learning== -> Teamwork and leadership program based on use of challenging, structured physical activities
* *Team training* -> Coordinating teamwork between individuals
  * ==Cross training== -> team members learn the skills necessary to perform tasks of others so they can step in when needed
  * ==Coordination trainig== -> teach team members how to better share information and cooperate
* *Action learning* -> Teams work on a real problem and determine a solution

## Implementing and Evaluating Training Program

### Principles of Learning

Effective training:

* Communicates learning objectives
* Presents information in a clear and memorable way
  * Carry out frequent training sessions
  * Provide feedback on trainee performance
* Help trainees link subject matter to jobs
  * Training context should mirror work environment

### Measuring Results of Training

Effective evaluation should follow the following evaluation levels:

* Level 1: Learner reactions
* Level 2: Demonstration of learning
* Level 3: Behaviour change
* Level 4: Business results
* Level 5: Cost-benefit analysis

Ultimate goal of training -> effective *transfer of learning*.

* Social support -> support from peers and organization
* Technical support -> allow employees to look up information they would like to review

Evaluation of training should consider **training outcomes**: any observable changes caused by the training.

Possible outcomes with regards to evaluation levels:

* Trainee learning satisfaction (level 1: reactions)
* Information recallable by trainees (level 2: demonstration of learning)
* Applying learned skills (level 3: behaviour change)
* Changes in behaviour (e.g. more concerned about safety) (level 3: behaviour change)
* Improvements in individual, team, or company performance (level 4: business results)
* Computations showing return on investment (level 5: cost-benefit)

**Test Sample**

Companies can evaluate effectiveness of training program by measuring performance of a sample of trainees before and after training.

* Performance *prior* to training is called ==pre-test==
* Post training is referred to as ==post-test==

## Approaches to Employee Development

Organizations can encourage employee development through several approaches categorized into -> formal education, assessment, job experiences, and interpersonal relationships.

### Formal Education

Organizations may support formal education programs.

* In-house workshops
* Short courses by educational institute
* MBA and executive MBA programs

### Assessment

Collect information on employee and provide feedback on current performance -> behaviour, communication style, or skills.

* Appropriate feedback should provide suggestions on how the employee can improve and on what areas.

**Tools to Gather Employee Information**

* Myers-Briggs Type Indicator
  * *Energy* -> dictates level of intro/extroversion
  * *Information gathering* -> preparations individuals make prior to making decisions
  * *Decision making* -> objective vs subjective thinking
  * *Lifestyle* -> tendency to be flexible or structured
* Assessment centres -> utilize multiple evaluators (assessors) to determine employee performance on specific exercises
* 360-degree feedback -> feedback coming from all stakeholders; supervisors, peers, reports, and customers
  * Multiple perspectives of performance
  * Establish formal communications on effective behaviour between employee and customers
  * Time constraints in completing feedback
  * Biases introduced by seeing the feedback given by others

### Interpersonal Relationships

Employees can develop skills by interacting with a more experienced person.

* Mentoring
  * **Mentor** -> experienced senior employee who helps develop a junior employee
  * Mentors able to have broader picture of organization
  * ==Artifically created relationships== would likely have difficulty
  * Advantages for mentors
    * Improve interpersonal and leadership skills
  * Advantages for mentees
    * Quickens career development
    * Supports continuous learning on all levels
    * Encourages environment where employees help one another
* Coaching
  * **Coach** -> Work with employee to provide motivation, develop skills, provide reinforcement and feedback
  * Differs from mentor
    * Focuses on completing a specific task and achieving high performance
    * Comes with the job

## Development-Related Challenges

### Glass Ceiling

Circumstances resembling an invisible barrier that prevents individuals from further development.

* Often related to women and minority groups
* Caused by lack of *access* to appropriate training, appropriate job development experiences, and/or mentorship opportunities
