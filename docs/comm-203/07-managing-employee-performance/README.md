# Managing Employees' Performance

Performance appraisals are crucial as they provide information to all members of an organization about what they need to succeed.

## Criteria for Effective Performance Management

* **Fit with strategy** — Performance management should aim at achieving employee behaviour and mindset that fits with the organization's strategy. 
  * If a company emphasises customer service, then the performance management should emphasise the behaviour that contribute to excellent performance.
	
* **Validity** — Does the performance appraisal measure all relevant aspects of performance?

* **Reliability** — Describes the consistency of the results that the performance measure will deliver.

* **Acceptability** — The people who use the performance measure must deem it acceptable. If management sees it as time-consuming, they will not use it. Likewise, if employees believe the measure is unfair, they will not use the feedback.

* **Specificity** — A performance measure should specifically tell employees what is expected of them and how they can meet those expectations.

## Performance Measurement Methods

### Rating Individuals

One way of measuring performance is to look at each employee's performance relative to a uniform set of standards.

> The set of "standards" is a set of attributes believed to be necessary for success in the job or organization.

### Rating Behaviour

**Behaviourally Anchored Rating Scale (BARS)**

Method of performance measurement that rates behaviour in terms of a scale showing specific statements of behaviour that describe different levels of performance.

### Rating Results

Performance measurement can focus on measuring the objective, measurable results of a job. Two of the most popular methods are *measurement of productivity* and *management by objectives*.

**Management by Objectives**

A system in which people at each level of an organization set goals in a process that flows from top to bottom. These goals become the standards for evaluating each employees' performance.
