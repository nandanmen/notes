# Collective Bargaining and Labour Relations

## Role of Unions and Labour Relations

Labour unions represent workers' interests and participates in bargaining processes with employers.

**Labour relations** refers to a set of skills managers and union leaders can use to minimize cost of conflict and seek win-win solutions in disagreements.

Labour relations involve three levels of decisions:

* *Labour relations strategy*
	* For **management**, this decision involves how the organization will work with unions or develop nonunion operations.
	* For **unions**, this decision involves whether to resist management changes or accept new kinds of labour-management relationships.
	* This decision is influenced by outside factors such as public opinion and competition.
* *Negotiating contracts*
	* Contract negotiations involve decisions on pay structure, job security, work rules, workplace safety, etc.
* *Administering collective agreements*
	* These decisions involve day-to-day activities in which union members and the organization may have disagreements.
	* e.g. work rules being violated or workers being treated unfairly.
	* A formal grievance procedure is usually used to resolve these issues.

### Types of Unions

* Union members generally belong to either national or international unions.
* Unions are traditionally characterized as either *craft* or *industrial* unions.
* Unions affiliate with labour congresses for assistance at the national or international level. The **Canadian Labour Congress** has the most affiliation coverage compared to other labour congresses in Canada.

#### Local Unions

Most national unions consist of several **local** units. Negotiation often occurs at the local level for things such as work rules and other issues that are locally determined.

### Trends in Union Membership

In Canada there is a decline in union membership. There are several factors that seem to contribute to this:

* *Change in economic structure*
	* Job growth among women and youth in service sector
	* Most union members are urban blue-collar middle-aged workers
* *Management efforts against unionization*
	* Almost half of large employers said their most important labour goal is to be union free

### Impact of Unions on Company Performance

With regards to <mark>productivity</mark>:

* Unions may decrease productivity if:
	* Limits are set on workloads
	* Production lost to union action e.g. strikes/work slowdowns
* Unions may increase productivity if:
	* Reduce turnover by giving employees a way to solve problems
	* Emphasize pay systems based on seniority which removes incentives to compete vs to cooperate

Unions have other effects on company performance as well:

* Management may be forced to pay greater than attention to employee needs and improve management practices
* Unions generally have a <mark>negative</mark> effect on profits
	* Union members are paid higher than nonunion members
	* Higher union productivity does not counteract pay increases

## Goals of Unions and Management

### Management

#### Primary goals

* Increase organization profits and/or increase productivity
* Prefer options that lower cost and raise output

#### Concerns

* Unions incur higher wages and benefits
* Raise risk of work stoppages
* Make managers and workers into opponents
* Limit management power over making business decisions

#### In labour relations

* Limit increases in wages and benefits
* Retain control over work rules and schedules

### Unions

#### Primary goals

* Obtain pay, job security, and working conditions that satisfy their members
* Provide members with a voice in decisions that affects them

#### Methods

* Unions gather their strength through numbers. More union members means more power to the union.
* Large unions also have the financial means to hold longer strikes.
* Unions want to influence the *way* pay and promotions are determined.
	* Have pay be determined on seniority alone
		* The assumption is this pay is more objective than performance evaluations
	* Unionized workers under a particular job classification are generally paid the same rate

#### Rand Formula

To survive, unions must ensure a regular flow of new members and member dues. The *Rand Formula* is a union security measure that enforces payment of labour union dues even if the worker is not part of the union.

* The rationale is that all employees benefit from unionization.

The Rand formula is implemented in several ways:

1. **Checkoff provision**: Employees automatically deduct union dues from employee paycheques.
2. **Closed shop**: A new employee must be a union member prior to being hired.
3. **Union shop**: Employees must join the union within a certain period of time after beginning employment.

## Laws and Regulations Affecting Labour Relations

The **Labour Relations Code** (LRC) is a set of laws that regulates the union's size and bargaining power.

Differs by province, but in BC its primary goals are:

* Protect rights of employees to union representation
* Guards against "unfair labour practices" e.g. retaliation, discipline, threats against employees
* Sets rules for collective bargaining, strikes, and resolution of disputes (grievances)

The labour relations legislation has several overriding principles:

* Maintenance of harmonious labour relations and industrial peace
	* Key rule is **no strikes** can occur during term of collective agreement
* Protect employee freedom of choice
* Maintain employer right to run business as long as no interference with above

## Union Organizing Process

1. *Membership application*
	* Union representatives contact employees and invite them to sign an application for membership
	* By signing the application, the employee indicates they want the union to represent them
2. *Certification*
	* When the union collects enough members, the union will apply to the appropriate LRB for certification.
	* In BC, 45% of employees in Bargaining Unit must be members.
	* "Representation Vote" is held; in BC, 55% of employees must show support for union.

### Bargaining Unit

Refers to the group of individuals that is represented by a union in collective bargaining.

* The LRB has the *exclusive jurisdiction* to determine appropriate bargaining unit.
* Requires **balance** to maintain bargaining rights of employees and managers.

Some positions are excluded from the bargaining unit and as such will not be covered by the collective agreement:

* Independent contractors
* Positions exercising managerial capacity
	* Specifically those positions with power over employment (hiring, firing, wages, etc.)
* Positions acting in *confidential* capacity over labour relations

### Management Strategies

Employers may retaliate when they learn that a large majority of employees have signed membership applications.

Supervisors have the most direct impact on whether unionizations will go through because they have the most direct contact with employees.

**What to do**

* Report any direct or indirect signs of union activity to core management
* State company response to employees (should be coordinated with rest of company)
* Follow effective management practices to avoid union issues altogether:
	* Deliver recognition and appreciation
	* Solve employee problems
	* Protect employees from harassment or humiliation
	* Provide business-related information
	* Be consistent when treating employees
	* Accommodate special circumstances when appropriate
	* Ensure due process in performance management
	* Treat all employees with dignity and respect

**What to avoid**

* Threat employees with harsher terms
* Interrogate employees about pro-union or anti-union sentiments
* Promising employees with favourable terms if they forego union activity

---

Generally, management have four options:

1. *Union Acceptance*
	* Accept inevitability of union involvement
	* <mark>Objective</mark>: negotiate best possible collective agreement
2. *Union Resistance*
	* Create opposition in organizing drives of sectors of company without union operations
3. *Union Removal*
	* Remove union that is already in place
	* Drag out bargaining while simultaneously increase wages and benefits for non-union workers
	* Brings high risk of strike activity
4. *Union Avoidance/Substitution*
	* Mimic union benefits
	* Provide greater participation in management through joint employee-management councils
	* Alternatively match wages with unionized employees in same industry

## Collective Bargaining

Determination of terms and conditions of employment through negotiations which results in a **Collective Agreement**.

### Collective Agreement

* Terms and conditions of employment that applies equally to *all* employees
* Regulate aspects of day-to-day relationships between workers, unions, and employers

#### What is management looking for?

* Leave as many management rights as possible
* **Factors affecting their decision**:
	* Prior experience with collective agreements
	* Grievances and arbitration decisions
	* Feedback from managers
	* Business plans
	* Economic forecasts
	* Contract settlements

#### What are unions looking for?

* Objectify and define terms of all management decisions
* Predictability, security, and best possible terms for workers
* **Factors affecting their decision**:
	* Prior experience with collective agreements
	* Grievances and arbitration decisions
	* Input from bargaining unit members
	* Economic forecast

#### Terms

* *Mandatory* terms
	* Minimum of one year term
	* Prohibition of strikes and lockouts
	* Provision for the arbitration of disputes
* *Voluntary* terms
	* Terms not required by legislation
	* Usually things like wages, benefits, vacations, work hours and scheduling, contracting out, etc.

### Approaches to Bargaining

* *Distributive bargaining*
	* Divides an "economic pie" between the members
	* Providing higher wages means employees get a larger "share of the pie" while employees get a smaller share
* *Integrative (mutual-gains) bargaining*
	* Looks for win-win solutions
	* e.g. if labour costs is detrimental to an organization's performance, integrative bargaining will look to avoid layoffs in favor of work rules that improve productivity
* *Attitudinal structuring*
	* Focuses on establishing trust between parties
	* Parties are mainly concerned with ensuring the other party will keep their side of the bargain
* *Intraorganizational bargaining*
	* Address conflicts **within** union or management groups

### When Bargaining Breaks Down

#### Strikes

A collective decision by union members not to work or slow down work until certain demands or conditions are met.

Strikes in BC must comply to the BC LRC:

* At least 72 hours notice to management and LRB
* Management **not allowed to hire** individuals to perform work of striking individuals

#### Lockout

A decision by the **employer** to close a place of employment or refuse to provide work as a way to compel employees to agree to certain demands or conditions.

#### Alternatives

* *Mediation*
	* A third party or **mediator** hears the views of both sides and regulates the negotiation process
	* Has no formal authority to impose a solution
* *Conciliation*
	* A third party reports the reasons for dispute, the views and arguments of both sides, and sometimes a recommended settlement
	* The parties *may* decline the recommended settlement
	* Usually used in disputes with government bodies
* *Arbitration*
	* An arbitrator or arbitration board determines a settlement that is **binding**, i.e. both parties must accept the settlement

### Seniority vs. Ability

Unions aim to compensate employees based on seniority whereas management seeks to compensate based on performance.

* *Straight seniority*
	* Applied to benefits (i.e. vacation days, sick leave)
	* More senior person -> more benefits
	* Sometimes applied to layoffs
		* e.g. employer must lay off in reverse order of seniority
* *Sufficient ability*
	* Promotion provides emphasis on seniority *then* ability
	* A senior person with minimum qualifications gets the promotion
* *Relative ability*
	* Person with best skill and abilities win promotion/job
	* Seniority is used in the event of **ties** only

## Part 1 Questions

* Explain how the labour relations board regulates the certification process.
* Identify workers who are prevented from unionization and the reasons for their exclusion
* How are bargaining units determined?

## Administration of the Collective Agreement

Administration refers to carrying out the terms of the agreement and resolving any disputes over the interpretation or violation of these terms.

**Grievance procedure** refers to the process for resolving these conflicts. These procedures typically follow a 4-step process:

1. Employee and union steward discusses problem with supervisor
	* In the discussion, employee and union steward decides if the problem is solved and/or whether any terms of the contract is violated
2. Written grievance is submitted to manager or labour relations representative
	* Steward and manager discusses grievance
	* Managements sends a response in writing
3. Union appeals grievance to top management or senior labour relations staff
	* Additional union officers may be involved
	* Decision on appeal is put into writing
4. Union decides whether to refer unresolved grievance to arbitration

Most grievances are resolved in the early steps of the process.

## Fairness and Discipline

### Fairness

Injustice/unfairness in the workplace will lead to negative employee behaviours.

* Three dimensions of fairness/justice
	* *Distributive justice*: Was the outcome appropriate and justified?
	* *Procedural justice*: Were procedures used to make the decision appropriate and unbiased?
	* *Interpersonal justice*: Were individuals treated with respect and dignity?
		* Was sufficient information provided about decisions and how it was made?

### What Behaviours Require Discipline?

Employer has the authority to discipline and discharge employees given **just cause**.

* But if disciplinary procedures laid out in CA is not followed, the discipline/discharge can be reversed

#### Culpable behaviour

**Culpable behaviour** refers to all conduct that are either *blameworthy* or have occurred through *intentional* actions.

Disciplinary action on culpable behaviour is reviewed against three questions:

1. Is there *just and reasonable cause* for some form of discipline?
2. Was decision an *excessive response*?
3. If so, what *lesser penalty* can be substituted?

#### Non-culpable behaviour

**Non-culpable behaviour** refers to *unacceptable* conduct that cannot be attributed to the *fault* of the employee.

* e.g. absenteeism due to illness or incompetence

Proper *discussion* must be done with the employee prior to dismissal.

* Managers must be diligent in communications with employee
* Employer has a right to discuss the problem with the employee *after* an attempt to correct it has been made
* Only if either fails then is dismissal an appropriate option

Employers must meet the following five criteria in order to dismiss an employee for *non-culpable* inability to do the job:

1. Provide a definition for an *objective standard* of the job
2. *Clear communication* of that standard to employee
3. *Supervisory discretion* provided to assist employee to reach that standard
4. *Warning* that continued failure to meet standard will result in dismissal
5. *Proof* that employee performance was below standard

**Insubordination** refers to a refusal by an employee to follow a work-related order given by a person of authority.

* Exceptions include:
	* Threat to employee safety
	* Compliance results in an illegal act

### Issues Considered When Disciplining

* Previous record of grievor
* Length of service of grievor
* Was the incident an *isolated* event?
* Potential provocation
* Premeditated or spontaneous *emotional* event
* Will penalty imposed cause economic hardship?
* Were the rules of the company *uniformly enforced*?
* Seriousness of event

### Forms of Discipline

*Discipline* refers to a procedure that corrects or punishes an employee when a rule of procedure has been violated.

A **fair** disciplinary process follows three rules:

1. A clear set of **rules and regulations**
2. System of **progressive penalties**
	* Repeated offences carry progressively harsher penalties
	* e.g. oral warning → written warning → short suspension → long suspension → termination
3. An appropriate **appeal process**

| Union | Non-Union |
| :----- | :--------- |
| Must have grievance and arbitration process | Cannot suspend unless employee contract provides for it |
| Can suspend employees who are guilty of a misconduct (subject to it being reduced or rescinded by an arbitrator) | May dismiss *without notice* if employee is guilty of **serious** misconduct (but employee can sue for wrongful dismissal) |
| When a union employee is dismissed they can file a *grievance* | May dismiss an employee given *reasonable notice* and *severance pay* |

## Part 2 Questions

* Explain the difference between culpable and non-culpable behaviour.
* How would you advise a company to develop a fair disciplinary procedure?
